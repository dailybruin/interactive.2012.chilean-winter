	<p>Aliza Sepulvo held a sign at an Aug. 24 candlelight vigil for Manuel Gutierrez, a high school student who died as a result of protest violence.</p>

	<p>Sixteen-year-old Gutierrez died on Aug. 25, 2011 when a policeman shot him near a student demonstration during a two-day education strike. </p>

	<p>Police said they fired because they saw protesters shooting at them.</p>

	<p>Sepulvo said he came to the vigil because police violence toward civilians reminds him of a time he’d rather not remember: Chile’s years under dictator Augusto Pinochet. </p>

	<p>“Police didn’t kill Manuel for doing something illegal; they killed him for being a student,” Sepulvo said. “People have to be conscious of that, because we can’t let this generation be a repeat of what happened during the dictatorship.”</p>
