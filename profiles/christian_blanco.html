	<p>Christian Blanco is a researcher at the Chilean Ministry of Education. He analyzes how students use the information available to them to make decisions about which college to attend.</p> 

	<p>As a sociologist, Blanco said he sees the student movement as a battle of business interests versus student needs. He said some universities have teamed up with corporations so school administrators can profit.</p>

	<p>“Legally, universities aren’t supposed to profit,” he said. “But if your wife or friend or company owns the building you rent, then you profit. There are loopholes.” </p>
