	<p class="italics">The NYU grad returning to Chile</p>

	<p>After venturing to the United States for graduate school, Anely Ramirez returned to her native Chile last year to take a research position with the Ministry of Education.</p>

	<p>Ramirez got an undergraduate degree in Chile. Like all Chilean students, she was forced to choose a career focus before her first day at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. There was no time to sample general education courses, and professors didn’t ask for student opinions like they did during her graduate lectures at New York University.</p>

	<p>“In Chile, you’re not allowed to think outside the box,” she said. “The U.S. school system is more flexible.”</p>
