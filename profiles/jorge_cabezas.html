	<p class="italics">Voting to remain en toma</p>

	<p>Jorge Cabezas, a student at Instituto Nacional, waited to cast his vote in favor of his high school campus remaining en toma.</p> 

	<p>Cabezas wants to go to the University of Chile and study abroad in Germany. He said it’s likely his plans will become reality, because Instituto Nacional prepares its students well for college entrance exams. He also has enough money to foot the bill at his dream school.</p>

	<p>“There are lots of people who have to find a scholarship if they want to keep studying after high school,” Cabezas said. “They don’t have resources like I do.”</p>
