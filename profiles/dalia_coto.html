	<p class="italics">Marching Through Gas</p>

	<p>Dalia Coto held a sliced lemon, a remedy for the burning throat sensation that comes with tear gas.</p> 

	<p>Police use gas and water cannons to disperse lingering protesters after a march’s designated end time. Coto, a psychology student at the University of Chile, stood nearby when police threw a gas canister into the crowd at the Aug. 28 march for education.</p> 

	<p>Her eyes still glistening with tears, Soto said marches are a way to show Chileans that student protesters are a bigger population than the press makes them out to be.</p>

	<p>“I know at the end [of a march] there will be fights with police, but that doesn’t scare me,” she said. “The message we’re sending the government is that we’re not the minority; we’re the majority.”</p>
