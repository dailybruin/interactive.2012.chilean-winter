	<h2>Julia Carrillo</h2>
	<p class="italics">The American Activist</p>

	<p>At the suggestion of a friend she met in a hostel, Julia Carrillo went to her first student-led march four days after arriving in Santiago, Chile in June 2011 for a University of California Education Abroad Program.</p>

	<p>It was there that Carrillo, now a fourth-year political science student at UC Berkeley, first tasted a typical protest: peaceful chanting, dancing and flag-waving that unraveled as police broke up the crowd with tear gas and water cannons. She said she had watched friends of hers join protesters to occupy Sproul Hall at Berkeley in 2009, but it was a smaller-scale action than this.</p>

	<p>“I had never seen anything like it,” Carrillo said. She was hooked.</p>

	<p>Carrillo originally only planned to stay in Santiago for a semester, but she fell in love with the Chilean student movement. She extended her stay twice, was arrested once and took part in over a dozen large-scale marches and demonstrations.</p>

	<p>To “catch up” to her new Chilean friends’ level of knowledge, Carrillo pored over newspapers and blogs, learning about the country’s dictatorial history. She said she picked up a new perspective from Chilean protesters during her months away from home: When an entire student community gets involved, it can drive real results.</p>

	<p>“I lived and breathed this movement,” Carrillo said. “It’s all I did, all I focused on.”</p>

	<p>Carrillo said that before she lived in Chile her experiences taught her that education should be free.</p>

	<p>Her mother and father grew up in Mexico and Argentina, respectively, where public primary schools are free. Her time at Berkeley has been funded almost entirely by a scholarship.</p>

	<p>Months ago, Carrillo got an outline of Chile tattooed on her spine. The procedure was painful but symbolic.</p>

	<p>“Even after one year, this country made a mark on me,” Carrillo said.</p>

	<p>Now back in the U.S. after a year and a half in Santiago, Carrillo said she plans to tour UC campuses to share her vision for a Californian student movement- one with localized cells of activists, like in Santiago. These groups would come together under a statewide coalition but work mainly on their individual campuses to rally the most students possible.</p>

	<p>“Putting ideas to practice is the best possible way for me to continue the lessons learned from Chile,” Carrillo said. “I feel a responsibility to start conversations about our UC system.”</p>
