	<p class="italics">Marching Through Gas</p>

	<p>Daniela Coto held a sliced lemon, a remedy for the burning sensation in the throat that comes with tear gas.</p>
	<p>Police use gas and water cannons to disperse lingering protesters after a march’s designated end time. Coto, a psychology student at the University of Chile, stood nearby when police threw a gas canister into the crowd at a Aug. 28 march for education.</p>
	<p>Soto said marches are a way to show Chileans that student protesters are a bigger population than the press makes them out to be.</p>
	<p>“I know at the end (of a march) there will be fights with police, but that doesn’t scare me,” she said. “The message we’re sending the government is that we’re not the minority; we’re the majority.”</p>
