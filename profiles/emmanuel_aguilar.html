	<h2>Emmanuel Aguilar-Posada</h2>
	<p class="italics">UCLA student</p>


	<p>A fourth-year anthropology student at UCLA, Emmanuel Aguilar-Posada studied abroad in Chile for six months in 2012.</p> 
	<p>He would have attended classes with Chileans at the University of Chile – if the campus was not on strike. When classes were cancelled for two weeks in August, Aguilar-Posada met privately with his professors and continued turning in assignments so he would still receive credit for coursework and avoid falling behind at UCLA.</p> 
	<p>“It’s my responsibility to deal with my grades, and I have no problem with that,” he said. “I value the strikes as part of my experience here. They’re part of the culture.”</p> 
	<p>When class is in session, Aguilar-Posada said student movement leaders often stop in during the last few minutes of a lecture to ask for feedback about the week’s protest efforts and advertise upcoming events.</p> 
	<p>Aguilar-Posada said he finds Chilean students more politically conscious and aware of global happenings than his friends at UCLA. He once debated American health care options with a friend who had never left Chile. The friend won.</p> 
	<p>“Chileans are more well-spoken than Americans,” Aguilar-Posada said. “Ideas just shoot out of their mouths. It’s intimidating.”</p>
