	<p class="italics">Public school student</p>

	<p>Jorge Villas called for a vote from about 30 of his classmates to decide whether to stage a toma, or student takeover, at their public school.</p>
	<p>Students from Instituto Nacional, one of Chile’s most prestigious public schools, had met at the University of Chile administration building where their college counterparts were camping out.</p>
	<p>“We have a basic right as students to a free quality education,” Villas told his classmates. “Even though it’s a long and hard process, we have to do something because the adults in our country aren’t doing anything.”</p>
	<p>A toma at Instituto Nacional began a few days later.</p>

<div class="definition" name="toma">Perhaps the movement’s most iconic display of discontent, a toma involves disgruntled students taking over their campuses, piling desks and chairs up high against the front gates. Classes can’t take place during a toma because students live and sleep in the school buildings. </div>
