	<p>Jorge Villas called for a vote from about 30 of his classmates to decide whether to stage a <span class="define italics" name="toma">toma</span>, or student takeover, at their high school.</p>

	<p>Students from Instituto Nacional, one of Chile’s most prestigious high schools, had met at the University of Chile administration building where their college counterparts were camping out.</p>

	<p>“We have a basic right as students to a free quality education,” Villas told his classmates. “Even though it’s a long and hard process, we have to do something because the adults in our country aren’t doing anything.”</p>

	<p>A <span class="define italics" name="toma">toma</span> at Instituto Nacional began a few days later.</p>
