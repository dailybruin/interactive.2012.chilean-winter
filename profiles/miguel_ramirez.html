	<p class="italics">Protesting until the end</p>

	<p>High school student Miguel Ramirez paraded through empty streets following a student protest on Aug. 28.</p>

	<p>As leftover tear gas trickled down side streets, alleyways morphed into foggy landscapes littered with burning piles of torn banners. </p>

	<p>“[The gas] is horrible,” Ramirez said. “You can’t breathe; your eyes hurt. It’s worth it though, because our system is totally unfair.”</p>
