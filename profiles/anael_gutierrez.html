	<h2>Anael Gutierrez</h2>
	<p class="italics">Struggling to pay</p>

	<p>Anael Gutierrez will have to pay about 15 million pesos - or almost $32,000 - in loans when he graduates from the University of Chile three years from now.</p>

	<p>From a poor high school in the beach town of La Serena, Gutierrez was the only one of his class to be accepted at what is arguably Chile’s most respected university.</p> 

	<p>After he failed four college courses, though, he no longer qualified for his full scholarship and scrambled to find loans. His classmates who went to expensive high schools don’t struggle with school like he does, Gutierrez said.</p>

	<p>“I lost my scholarship because I didn’t have the same education foundation as all of my peers,” he said. “They were more prepared than I was.”</p>

	<p>Gutierrez works part-time at a grocery store to cover the costs of books and food while he takes classes in public administration. He said he’s optimistic he’ll be able to repay his loans after college, because a degree from the University of Chile has high earning power. </p>

	<p>Many students from poor backgrounds, however, can’t anticipate such high earnings and are forced to drop out of college, he said.</p>

	<p>“When you enter the university with a very basic education, it’s difficult to get good grades and maintain a scholarship,” Gutierrez said. “That’s why a lot of poor students leave. The current system creates a cycle.”</p>
