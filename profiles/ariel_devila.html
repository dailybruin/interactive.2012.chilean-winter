	<p class="italics">Supporting the rest</p>

	<p>Ariel Devila showed off a poster of Manuel Gutierrez, the only student who has died from protest-related violence.</p>

	<p>Devila studies at a private high school, yet he marched in remembrance of the public school student he never knew. Devila wants to pursue art in college. He said he thinks he’ll get into the University of Chile.</p>

	<p>“There needs to be more equality in education,” Devila said. “The support we get from university students helps. If we march in a big mass of people, people will listen to our ideas.”</p>
